# Haskell Torch Imagemagick bindings

This package is part of the Haskell-Torch ecosystem. Check out the documentation
[there](https://github.com/abarbu/haskell-torch).

It's only meant to be used as part of Haskell-Torch. The interface isn't user
friendly, only relevant functions are included, and it's not safe. It's an
internal, not a user-facing library.
