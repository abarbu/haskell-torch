# Haskell Torch tools

This package is part of the Haskell-Torch ecosystem. Check out the documentation
[there](https://github.com/abarbu/haskell-torch).

This contains tools required to generate bindings for Haskell-Torch. There's
nothing user-facing or reusable here. It's only used by the build system.
